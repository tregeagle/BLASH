Tiago Forte introduced me to Niklas Luhmann and his 'Zettelkasten' in this [post](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/). The German word Zettelkasten translates as chit box. A chit being a slip of paper or an index card.

I remember as a child learning to use an index card system for borrowing books from my local Library. Luhmann wrote brief notes on index cards and filed them carefully using his own system. He referred to his system as his <i>Thinking Tool</i> because he would access his written thoughts almost as if having a conversation with his extended brain (Schmidt 2018).

Daniel Luedecke developed [Zettelkasten](http://zettelkasten.danielluedecke.de/index.php) a multiplatform program to replicate Luhmann's system which is very popular amongst the community of Zettelkasten enthusiasts. We live in the hyperconnected 21st century and there is a community for everything. Luedecke's software is good but I prefer plain old text files which I can organise with bash scripts to access in the browser. Francesco Bertolaccini has written [BLASH](https://github.com/frabert/BLASH), a simple and neat collection of bash scripts. I am exploring using this for my own Index Card System (AKA web log). Luhmann wrote over 90,000 ideas on his index cards (Schmidt 2018). I have not written quite so many.
